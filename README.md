# Graphical_Representation_of_Epistemic_Embeddings-

# Introduction

Epistemological connections between seemingly unrelated domains remain stringent for the human brain to capture. Technologies such as Google&#39;s page rank, do capture these epistemological connections inherently, yet it&#39;s not intuitive for a human brain to digest.

The act of surfing knowledge is much more accessible now than ever before in history. Gazillions of materials are just a single click away. Much more often than not, it becomes quite tedious to make sense of this ordered chaos, to extract what you need from this ocean of texts.

This project shall aim at one such visualization of Graph Representation of Epistemic Embeddings on Wikipedeic r√©seau. Such representations shall aid the user to get a birds eye view of the epistemic connections as well as help technologies like knowledge graphs to build upon it. We shall crawl starting from a given Wikipedia topic, to a defined depth, capturing the relationships between &quot;Wikipedia pages&#39;&#39;.

## 1a. Properties summary

| **s.no** | **variable** | **description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **URL** url | The variable which stores the URL object of a url link of the wikipedia website which is to be parsed |
| **2** | **URLConnection** conn | A variable to store an object of the URLConnection class which is used to represent a communication link between the URL and the application |
| **3** | **BufferedReader** stream | A variable to store an object of the BufferedReader class which is used to Read text from a character input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines. |
| **4** | **String** rooturl | A variable which is used to store the string of url link of the wikipedia website which is to be parsed |

## 1b. Constructor summary

| **s.no** | **constructor** | **usage** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | Crawler() | The constructor Crawler() which doesn&#39;t accept any parameter simply instantiates the three properties url, conn and stream to null values. |
| **2** | Crawler( **String** url) | The constructor Crawler(String url) which accepts the string url which is the url link of the wikipedia website which is to be parsed is used to create a new URL object which points to a resource on the World Wide Web, instantiates a connection object and assign it to URLConnection instance that represents a connection to the remote object referred to by the URL, instantiates a bufferedreader object and assigns it to InputStreamReader object which returns an InputStream representing the data and throws the appropriate exception if it cannot do so and the string values url is stored in the property rooturl. |

## 1c. User-defined methods

| **s.no** | **method** | **usage** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **ArrayList**** \&lt; ****String**** \&gt;** crawl() | This method doesn&#39;t accept any arguments. It creates 3 different variables at the time of invocation, the first one is &#39;inputline&#39; which stores the HTML code of the website and two arraylists URLs and URLss are created. This method is used to populate the list URLs with the URL of the hyperlinks present in any website. The URLs present in this list are then filtered and valid URLs from this are stored in the list URLss. Here the number of hyperlinks fetched is limited to 9, since fetching all the hyperlinks becomes a time-consuming process. |
| **2** | **ArrayList**** \&lt; ****String**** \&gt;**crawl(**String** url) | This method which accepts the string url which is the url link of the wikipedia website which is to be parsed as an argument initially performs the tasks which are done by the constructor Crawler(String url) and in the latter part it completes the same task done by the method crawl() which accepts no arguments. |
| **3** | **String** ToString ( **ArrayList**** \&lt; ****Character**** \&gt;** list) | This method accepts an arraylist of character elements and converts it to an arraylist of string elements. |

| **2** | **Node** addNode( **String** url) | This method which accepts the string url which is the url link of the wikipedia website which is to be parsed as an argument checks if the node object corresponding to the URL is present in the list of node of objects, if it is present, the method returns a reference to that node object, if it is not present it performs the same tasks as the addNode() method does. |
| **3** | **boolean** isInNodes( **String** url) | This method accepts the string url which is the url link of the wikipedia website which is to be parsed as an argument and checks if the corresponding node object is present in the arraylist &quot;nodes&quot;, returns TRUE if it is present and FALSE if it is absent. |
| **4** | **void** addEdge( **Node** a, **Node** b) | This method accepts two node objects as it&#39;s argument and creates an edge object between the same. This method also appends node &quot;a&quot; to the list of connected nodes of &quot;b&quot; and appends &quot;b&quot; to the list of connected nodes of &quot;a&quot;. |
| **5** | **void** addEdge( **int** x, **int** y) | This method accepts two integers &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; which correspond to the position of reference to the node objects of two nodes in order to fetch the node object corresponding to it and performs the same task as addEdge(Node a,Node b) using the two fetched nodes. |
| **6** | **void** connect() | This method accepts no arguments and uses the adjacency matrix in order to create a new spring object between the two nodes which correspond to the (row,column) ordered pair where the (row,column)th element of the adjacency matrix is 1. |
| **7** | **Node** findNode( **String** url) | This method accepts the string url which is the url link of the wikipedia website which is to be parsed as an argument. This method checks if the node object corresponding to the URL is present in the arraylist &quot;nodes&quot;, if it is present it returns the reference to the corresponding node object and if it is not present, the method returns a new node object corresponding to this URL. |
| **8** | **void** show() | This method is used to display circles in the place of all node objects and is used to display lines in the place of all spring objects or node objects. |
